# Warner Bros. Website 

## Overview
This project is a multi-page website created to replicate the style and structure of a modern entertainment platform — similar to Warner Bros. or Netflix. The website includes different sections showcasing movies, TV shows, collections, games, and a feedback page. It was built using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as part of a first-year school assignment.

## Features
-  **Home Page**: Introduction and overview
-  **Movie Page**: Movie titles and posters
- **TV Shows Page**: Series gallery
-  **Collections Page**: Curated content bundles
-  **Games Page**: Game previews
- **Feedback Page**: User input form

Users can navigate smoothly between pages using a top navigation bar present on all pages.
